\section{Experimental approach}

Study if tagging in situ is possible.

Approach: 

\begin{itemize}
\item identify ion position from kinematical reconstruction in HPXe.
\item Scan barium vertex until barium ion found.
\item Pump with blue laser and if needed with infrared laser.
\item Record red light.
\end{itemize}
